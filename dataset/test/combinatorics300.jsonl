{"solution": "Answer: 267903.\n\nSolution. Consider the case when one of the selected cards has a one written on it. Then, on the other two cards, even powers of two and three must be recorded. There are 51 ways to choose an even power of two and 51 ways to choose an even power of three, and since this choice is made independently, the total number of ways in this case is $51^{2}=2601$.\n\nNow let's move on to the case when the card with one is not used.

Since the power of two in the product of the selected numbers must be even, the powers of two on the selected cards must have the same parity.

{"solution": "Answer: 370330\n\nSolution. There are two possible cases.\n\n1) Both selected nodes lie on the lines specified in the condition. Each of them contains 58 points inside the square, and there are no repetitions among them (the intersection point of the lines has non-integer coordinates).

{"solution": "Solution. Answer: $\\frac{1011 \\cdot 1012}{2}=511566$.\n\nLet's write our numbers in the following order: $2021,1,2020,2,2019,3, \\ldots, 1012,1010,1011$.\n\nNotice that if two numbers sum to 2021 or 2022, they stand next to each other in this sequence. Our task is reduced to the following: 2021 objects (for convenience, let's consider them as 2021 balls) are lined up, and we need to count the number of ways to choose 1010 of them, such that no two chosen balls are adjacent.\n\nLet's paint the unchosen balls red and the chosen ones blue. Place all 1011 red balls in a row. We need to place 1010 blue balls in the gaps between them (or at the ends) such that no two blue balls are adjacent. There are exactly 1012 such gaps: 1010 gaps between two red balls, and 2 gaps at the ends; in each of these gaps, we can place no more than one blue ball. Therefore, we need to count the number of ways to choose 1010 gaps out of 1012 available. As is known, this value is equal to $C_{1012}^{1010}=C_{1012}^{2}=\\frac{1012 \\cdot 1011}{2}=511566$.\n\nAnother solution.\n\nWe will divide the numbers from 1 to 2021 into 1011 groups - 1010 non-overlapping groups of pairs of numbers that sum to 2022 (specifically: $(1,2021),(2,2020), \\ldots,(1009,1013)$, $(1010,1012))$ and a group consisting of the remaining number 1011.\n\nIn each group, by the condition, we can choose no more than one number. Therefore, to choose 1010 numbers, we need to choose a group from which no numbers will be taken, and from all other groups, we need to choose exactly one number each.\n\nSuppose we do not take any number from the group $(a, 2022-a)$ (here and below we will assume that in such notation $a \\leqslant 2022-a$). From all other groups, we need to choose exactly one number each, in particular, we need to take 1011 (if $a=1011$, then this step is skipped). Then we cannot choose 1010 (otherwise $1011+1010=2021$), but then we must choose 1012 (otherwise nothing is chosen from the last pair). Then we cannot choose 1009 (otherwise $1012+1009=2021$), but then we must choose 1013 (otherwise nothing is chosen from the second-to-last pair). Continuing this way, we get that from the pair $(a+1,2022-(a+1))$ we choose the number $2022-(a+1)$. Thus, in all pairs where the smallest number is greater than $a$, the chosen numbers are uniquely determined (specifically, the largest numbers in these pairs must be chosen).\n\nNow consider all pairs where the smallest number is less than $a$. Consider among them the pair $(b, 2022-b)$ in which the largest number, i.e., $2022-b$, is chosen (the case where such pairs do not exist will be considered separately), and if there are several such pairs, consider the one where $b$ is maximal. From all pairs from $(b+1,2022-(b+1))$ to $(a-1,2022-(a-1))$, the smallest number was always chosen (due to the maximality of $b$). In the pair $(b-1,2022-(b-1))$, the number $2022-(b-1)$ was chosen (otherwise $(b-1)+(2022-b)=2021$). Similarly, in the pair $(b-2,2022-(b-2))$, the number $2022-(b-2)$ was chosen, and so on, in the pair $(1,2021)$, the number 2021 was chosen.\n\nNow let's understand how the set of numbers satisfying the condition is determined. First, a group $(a, 2022-a)$ (i.e., a number $1 \\leqslant a \\leqslant 1011$) is chosen, in which no number is chosen. Then, in all groups where the smallest number is greater than $a$, the choice is uniquely determined (from the group, the largest number is chosen). Second, a pair $(b, 2022-b)$ (i.e., a number $1 \\leqslant b \\leqslant a-1$) is chosen, and in all other pairs, the choice is uniquely determined (in pairs with the smallest number from $b+1$ to $a-1$, the smallest number is chosen, and in pairs where it is less than $b$, the largest number is chosen).\n\nIt remains to count the number of options. Fix some $a$, then the number of ways to choose $b$ will be exactly $a-1$, plus one more option, where in all pairs with the smallest number less than $a$, the smallest number was chosen (i.e., the number $b$ simply does not exist). In total, there are $a$ options for the number $b$. Summing over all $a \\leqslant 1011$, we get $1+2+3+\\ldots+1010+1011=\\frac{1011 \\cdot 1012}{2}=511566$ options for our set. Clearly, all these options are distinct and satisfy the condition (the set is uniquely determined by the chosen numbers $a$ and $b$).\n\n## Criteria\n\nThe highest appropriate criterion is used:\n\n7 p.

The number consisting of 9999 ones and a two, where before the two there are $100 m+n$ ones ($0 \\leq m, n \\leq 99$), is obtained by deleting all twos except the $(m+1)$-th, 99 ones before it, and $n$ ones after it. Estimation. Note that in the number $N$ there are no two consecutive twos - otherwise, it can be shortened by deleting one of these twos. Let the number $N$ have $k$ twos, with $a_{0}$ ones before the first two, $a_{1}$ ones between the first and second, ..., and $a_{k}$ ones after the last two. Let $s=a_{0}+\\ldots+a_{k}$. To obtain a number where there is one one before the two, we will have to delete at least $a_{0}-1$ ones. Therefore, the number $s-\\left(a_{0}-1\\right)$ must be at least 9999, i.e., $s-a_{0} \\geq 9998$. To obtain a number where there are $a_{0}+1$ ones before the two, we will have to delete the first two and at least $a_{1}-1$ ones, from which we get the inequality $s-a_{1} \\geq 9998$.

Reasoning similarly, we get that the inequality $s-a_{i} \\geq 9998$ holds for all $i$ from 0 to $k-1$; in addition, to obtain a number where the two is the last, it is required that $s-a_{k} \\geq 9999$.

{"solution": "Solution. If a number is divisible by 6, then it is divisible by 3 and 2. A number is divisible by 2 if and only if its last digit is even. The 980-digit number given in the condition ends with 2458710411, i.e., it has the form ...2458710411. For the number to be divisible by 2, it is necessary to strike out the last two ones so that the number ends with an even digit. The resulting number will have the form 2458710411...245871041124587104. Now it is necessary for this number to be divisible by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of the resulting number is:\n\n$(2+4+5+8+7+1+0+4+1+1) * 97 + (2+4+5+8+7+1+0+4) = 33 * 97 + 31 = 3232$.\n\nThe remainder of the division of the number 3232 by 3 is 1. This means that the numbers must be struck out in such a way that their sum is divisible by 3 and leaves a remainder of 1. Then, upon subtraction, a number will be obtained whose sum of digits will be exactly divisible by 3. The maximum sum that can be obtained by striking out digits is $16 (8+8)$. Therefore, it is necessary to consider all numbers from 0 to 16 that are divisible by 3 and leave a remainder of 1, and all possible combinations of their formation. These numbers are: $1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16$. The combinations by which they can be formed are as follows:\n\n$1 (0+1); 4 (0+4, 2+2); 7 (2+5, 7+0); 10 (5+5, 2+8); 13 (8+5); 16 (8+8)$.\n\nIt remains to calculate the number of ways in which each combination can be obtained. The first combination can be obtained by striking out one 1 and one 0. There are $97 * 3 + 1 = 292$ ones in our number, and 98 zeros. Therefore, the number of ways in which this can be done is $(97 * 3 + 1) * 98 = 28616$. For subsequent combinations, we get:\n\n$(0+4): 98 * 98 = 9604$\n\n$(2+2): 98 * 97 / 2 = 4753$\n\n$(2+5): 98 * 98 = 9604$\n\n$(7+0): 98 * 98 = 9604$\n\n$(5+5): 98 * 97 / 2 = 4753$\n\n$(2+8): 98 * 98 = 9604$\n\n$(5+8): 98 * 98 = 9604$\n\n$(8+8): 98 * 97 / 2 = 4753$.\n\nSumming all the obtained combinations, we get the number of ways 90895. However, it should be noted that one of the proposed ways is not suitable. If we strike out the last digits 0 and 4, then our number will end with 1, i.e., it will not be divisible by 2, and therefore, it will not be divisible by 6.

We will number the stones in each pile from bottom to top with numbers from 1 to 400. Then the number of points Petya gets on each move is equal to the difference of the numbers of the removed stones. As a result, he will get a sum of the form $\\left|a_{1}-a_{2}\\right|+\\left|a_{3}-a_{4}\\right|+\\ldots+\\mid a_{39999}-a_{40000}$, where $a_{i}$ are the numbers of the corresponding stones.\n\nNotice that after expanding the brackets, we get an algebraic sum $S$ of one hundred numbers 400, one hundred numbers 399, ..., one hundred twos, and one hundred ones, with a minus sign in front of exactly half of these numbers.\n\nWe will call the numbers from 1 to 200 small, and the rest - large. If it were allowed to take any stones from the piles, then the maximum value of $S$ is obviously achieved when all large numbers enter $S$ with a plus sign, and all small numbers - with a minus sign. Such a sum is equal to $100(400+399+\\ldots+201-200-199-\\ldots-1)=100((400-200)+(399-199)+\\ldots+(201-1))=100 \\cdot 200^{2}$.\n\nHowever, note that each large number will enter the sum with a minus sign at least once: this will happen, for example, the first time Petya removes a stone with this number. Similarly, each of the 200 small numbers will enter the sum with a plus sign at least once (the moment Petya removes the last stone with this number). Therefore, the maximum result Petya can achieve does not exceed $99 \\cdot(400+399+\\ldots+201)-99 \\cdot(200+199+\\ldots+1)-(400+399+\\ldots+201)+(200+199+\\ldots+1)=98 \\cdot 200^{2}$.\n\nExample.

{"solution": "Solution. First, we prove that the maximum transportation difficulty occurs when the cities are connected \"in a chain.\"\n\nIndeed, we can consider the graph as a tree (otherwise, we can remove some edges to leave a tree - the difficulty will increase). Choose the longest path in the tree. Suppose there are vertices not included in this path. Then among them, there is a pendant vertex $x$ (i.e., a vertex with only one edge leading to it). Let $y$ be the vertex on the longest path closest to $x$. Move the entire \"branch\" extending from $y$ and containing $x$ to the end of the longest path, the farthest from $y$. Note that as a result, the pairwise distances between the vertices within the \"branch\" do not change, nor do the distances between the vertices outside the branch. It is easy to see that for each vertex in the branch, the sum of the squares of the distances to all other vertices has increased. Indeed, if $k$ is the distance from some vertex $z$ in the branch to $y$, then the set of distances from $z$ to the vertices outside the branch (including $y$) was $k, k+1, k+1, k+2, k+2, \\ldots, k+s, k+s, k+s+1, k+s+2, \\ldots$, and it became $k, k+1, k+2, k+3, \\ldots$\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_5f3f20df45781134e3a1g-3.jpg?height=244&width=1510&top_left_y=1247&top_left_x=337)\n\nBy such \"re-hangings,\" we can bring the graph to the form of a chain, and the difficulty will always increase; hence, for the chain, it is maximal.\n\nNow we calculate the difficulty for the \"chain.\" The problem reduces to finding the sum $99 \\cdot 1^{2} + 98 \\cdot 2^{2} + 97 \\cdot 3^{2} + \\ldots + 1 \\cdot 99^{2}$.\n\nLet $S_{n}^{2} = 1^{2} + 2^{2} + \\ldots + n^{2}$, $S_{n}^{3} = 1^{3} + 2^{3} + \\ldots + n^{3}$.

{"solution": "Answer: 20000.\n\nSolution. First method. The number of different permutations of cards is finite. Therefore, their arrangement with the largest indicated sum exists (possibly not unique).\n\nLet the cards lie in such a way that this sum is maximal. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the top card is white. Then, in this arrangement, pairs of cards CB, BK, and WB cannot lie consecutively from top to bottom, otherwise, the sum can be increased by swapping them in such pairs (symmetric pairs do not increase the desired sum when swapped). Therefore, the cards must lie as follows (from top to bottom): WW...WBB...BBKK...KKWW...W...\n\nThe length of each subsequent series of cards of the same color cannot be less than the length of the previous series. Indeed, if, for example, in the arrangement with the largest sum, there is a fragment ...WWWBBK..., then the K card can be moved to the top: ...KWWWBB..., increasing the sum. Since the number of cards of each color is the same, the lengths of all series must be the same (otherwise, there will be more cards of the color that ends up at the bottom than cards of another color). Then the series of the same color can be rearranged \"in a cycle,\" without changing the sum, that is, to get such an arrangement of cards: 100 white cards on top, 100 black cards below them, and 100 red cards at the bottom. Therefore, the desired sum is $100 \\cdot 100 + 100 \\cdot 100 = 20000$.\n\nSecond method. Let the number of cards of each of the three colors be $n$. Using the method of mathematical induction, we will prove that for the specified sum $S$, the inequality $S \\leq 2 n^{2}$ holds.\n\nBase of induction. For $n=1$, by enumeration, we verify that $S \\leq 2$. Induction step: Suppose the inequality is true for $n$ cards of each color. We will prove that it is true if the number of cards of each color is $n+1$. Consider how the sum $S$ can increase if one card of each color is added. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the white card is added to the very top of the stack, and the added black and red cards are the topmost among the cards of their color. Let there be $b$ previously lying black cards above the first red card from the top, and $w$ previously lying white cards above the first black card from the top. Then the white card adds $n+1$ to the sum (considering all black cards lying below it), the black card adds $n+1$ (considering all red cards lying below it) and $w$, due to it lying below $w$ old white cards, and the red card adds no more than $n-w$ due to white cards lying below it and $b$ due to it lying below $b$ old black cards. In total, $S \\leq 2 n^{2} + n + 1 + n + 1 + w + n - w + b = 2 n^{2} + 3 n + b + 2$. Considering that $b \\leq n$, we get: $S \\leq 2 n^{2} + 4 n + 2 = 2(n+1)^{2}$.\n\nThus, the statement is proved for all natural $n$. For $n=100$, we get that $S \\leq 2 \\cdot 100^{2} = 20000$.

Consider an arbitrary coloring that satisfies the condition. Divide all the cells on the surface into \"edges\" as shown in Fig. 2 - 500 edges around each of the eight vertices (one of the edges is marked in gray). Then, in the $k$-th edge, counting from the vertex, there will be $S_{k}=6 k-3$ cells. Since no two colored cells can be adjacent, in this edge there will be no more than $\\left[\\frac{S_{k}}{2}\\right]=3 k-2=\\frac{S_{k}-1}{2}$ colored cells. Summing over all 4000 edges and noting that their total area is $6 \\cdot 1000^{2}$, we get that the total number of colored cells does not exceed $\\frac{6 \\cdot 1000^{2}-4000}{2}=$ $=3 \\cdot 10^{6}-2000$.\n\nIt remains to provide an example showing that so many cells can be colored. Let's call two opposite faces of the cube the top and bottom, and the others - side faces. On each of the side faces, half of the cells can be marked in a checkerboard pattern. After that, on the top and bottom faces, half of the cells can also be colored in all rows except the two outermost, leaving them empty - see Fig. 3, where two side faces and the top face are visible. It is easy to see that with such a coloring, in each edge there will be the maximum possible number of colored cells.

{"solution": "Solution. Let $N_{k}(k>1)$ denote the number of even $k$-digit numbers in which identical digits do not stand next to each other. Similarly, define $N_{1}$, but exclude the number 0, so $N_{1}=4$. We can directly calculate $N_{2}=41$. Let $k>2$. Notice that from $k$-digit numbers satisfying the condition, we can form suitable $(k+1)$-digit numbers by adding one of the 8 permissible digits (not zero and not the one in the highest place) to the left. In addition, $(k+1)$-digit numbers can be formed from $(k-1)$-digit numbers by adding one of the 9 non-zero digits and zero to the left. There are no other options. From this, we obtain the recurrence relation: $N_{k+1}=8 \\cdot N_{k}+9 \\cdot N_{k-1}$. Sequentially calculating the values using this formula, we find the answer: $N_{6}=265721$.\n\nRemark.

{"solution": "Answer. $6 \\cdot 50^{2}-5 \\cdot 50+1=14751$ pairs.\n\nSolution. Let the side length of the table be $2 n = 100$ (so $n=50$) and number the rows from top to bottom and the columns from left to right with numbers from 1 to $2 n$.\n\nIn each row, there can be from 0 to $2 n$ black cells. Since the number of black cells in all rows is different, these numbers are all numbers from 0 to $2 n$, except one (say, except $k$). Then the total number of black cells is $(0+1+\\ldots+2 n)-k=2 n^{2}+n-k$. On the other hand, since the number of cells in all columns is the same, the total number of black cells must be divisible by $2 n$. Therefore, $k=n$, and in all columns there are $2 n^{2} / (2 n) = n$ black cells.\n\nNow let's estimate the number of pairs of adjacent cells of different colors, considering separately pairs of cells adjacent horizontally and vertically.\n\nIf there are $i \\leqslant n-1$ black cells in a row, then they can participate in no more than $2 i$ horizontal pairs. If there are $i \\geqslant n+1$ black cells in a row, the same reasoning can be applied to the white cells, of which there are $2 n-i \\leqslant n-1$. Therefore, the number of horizontal pairs of different colors is no more than $2 \\cdot(2 \\cdot 0+2 \\cdot 1+\\ldots+2 \\cdot(n-1))=2 n(n-1)$.\n\nNow let's estimate the number of vertical pairs. Consider any row with an even number from 2 to $2(n-1)$; let there be $i$ black cells in it. Then either in the row above or in the row below it, the number of black cells is not equal to $100-i$; therefore, one of the vertical pairs in which the cells of our row participate will be of the same color. Therefore, there are at least $n-1$ same-color vertical pairs. Since the total number of vertical pairs is $2 n(2 n-1)$, the number of different-color vertical pairs is no more than $2 n(2 n-1)-(n-1)$. Therefore, the total number of different-color pairs is no more than $2 n(n-1)+\\left(4 n^{2}-3 n+1\\right)=6 n^{2}-5 n+1=14751$.\n\nIt remains to provide an example in which the specified number of pairs is achieved.

All cells lying above the diagonal will be painted black if the sum of their row and column numbers is even, and white otherwise (checkerboard coloring). An example of such a coloring for $n=4$ is shown in Fig. 3. It is easy to verify that in each column there are exactly $n$ black cells, in the $2 i$-th row there are $n+i$ black cells, and in the $(2 i-1)$-th row there are $-n-i$ black cells.

When $m=1$, exactly two rooks are on the diagonal, which can be arranged in $C_{8}^{2}=$ 28 ways. The remaining 6 rooks occupy 3 out of 28 pairs of symmetric non-diagonal cells. Therefore, there will be $C_{8}^{2} \\cdot C_{28}^{3}=91728$ such placements.\n\nBy similar reasoning, we find the number of required placements for $m=1$ and $m=3$, which are $C_{8}^{4} \\cdot C_{28}^{2}=26460$ and $C_{8}^{6} \\cdot C_{28}^{1}=784$ respectively.

{"solution": "9. First solution. Let's calculate the number of numbers in our sequence that do not contain the digit 1. Add the number 0 (zero) at the very beginning of this sequence and omit the last number 10000000000; we will get a sequence of $10^{10}$ numbers, containing one more number, in the notation of which the digit 1 does not appear, than the original sequence. Let's agree to prepend as many zeros to all numbers in the obtained sequence that are less than ten digits, so that they become ten-digit. The new sequence will consist of $10^{10}$ ten-digit numbers, starting from 0000000000 and ending with 9999999999. If a number in this sequence does not contain the digit 1, then this means that the first digit in this number is one of the nine digits 0, $2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9$. The second digit of the number must also be one of the same nine digits; combining 9 possible values of the first digit with 9 values of the second, we get a total of $9^{2}$ different possibilities for the first pair of digits. Similarly, for the first three digits of our number, we get $9^{3}$ different possibilities, for the first four digits $9^{4}$ different possibilities, and so on; finally, for the first ten digits, we get $9^{10}$ different possibilities. This means that in the sequence of numbers from 0000000000 to 9999999999, there are $9^{10}$ different numbers that do not contain the digit 1. Therefore, in the sequence of numbers from 1 to 10000000000, such numbers will be\n\n$$\n9^{10}-1=3486784401-1=3486784400\n$$\n\nand the numbers that contain the digit 1 will be\n\n$$\n10000000000-3486784400=6513215600 .\n$$\n\nThus, the numbers that contain the digit 1 will be more.\n\nSecond solution. Let's calculate the number of numbers in our sequence that contain the digit 1. Let's agree that a decade means ten consecutive positive integers, starting from a number ending in zero and ending with a number ending in 9; a hundred means a hundred consecutive integers, starting from a number ending in two zeros and ending with a number ending in two nines; a thousand means a thousand consecutive integers, starting from a number ending in three zeros and ending with a number ending in three nines, and so on. To make the first decade, the first hundred, the first thousand, and so on, complete, we will prepend the number 0 to the beginning of our sequence of numbers.\n\nIn the first decade, there is a single number that contains the digit 1--this is the number 1. The same number of numbers containing the digit 1 will be included in any other decade of the first hundred, except the second--the second decade (numbers from 10 to 19) consists entirely of numbers containing 1.\n\nTherefore, the first hundred contains\n\n$$\n9 \\cdot 1+10\n$$\n\nnumbers that contain the digit 1.\n\nExactly the same number of numbers that contain the digit 1 are contained in any other hundred of the first thousand, except the second--the second hundred consists entirely of numbers containing 1. Therefore, the first thousand contains\n\n$$\n9(9 \\cdot 1+10)+100=9^{2}+9 \\cdot 10+10^{2}\n$$\n\nnumbers that contain the digit 1.\n\nIn each thousand of the first ten thousand, except the second, there will be the same number of numbers that contain the digit 1, and the second thousand will consist entirely of such numbers. Thus, among the first 10000 numbers, there will be\n\n$$\n9\\left(9^{2}+9 \\cdot 10+10^{2}\\right)+1000=9^{3}+9^{2} \\cdot 10+9 \\cdot 10^{2}+10^{3}\n$$\n\nnumbers that contain the digit 1.\n\nContinuing to reason in the same way, we can easily show that among the first 10000000000 numbers from 0 to 9999999999, there are\n\n$$\n9^{9}+9^{8} \\cdot 10+9^{7} \\cdot 10^{2}+\\ldots+9 \\cdot 10^{8}+10^{9}\n$$\n\nnumbers that contain the digit 1. This sum is easily calculated using the formula for the sum of the terms of a geometric progression:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 9^{9}+9^{8} \\cdot 10+9^{7} \\cdot 10^{2}+\\ldots+9 \\cdot 10^{8}+10^{9}= \\\\\n&= \\frac{10^{9} \\cdot \\frac{10}{9}-9^{9}}{\\frac{10}{9}-1}=\\frac{\\frac{10^{10}}{9}-9^{9}}{\\frac{1}{9}}=10^{10}-9^{10}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn the sequence from 1 to 10000000000, the numbers containing 1 will be one more, i.e.,\n\n$$\n10^{10}-9^{10}+1=6513215600\n$$\n\nThis result, naturally, coincides with the one obtained in the first solution.

Further, among them, there will be 2222222 numbers ending in the digits 00 (numbers $100,200,300, \\ldots, 222222200$); 2222222 numbers ending in the digits 01 (numbers 101, 201, 301, ..., 222222201); 2222222 numbers ending in the digits 02; 2222222 numbers ending in the digits 03, and so on, finally, 2222222 numbers ending in the digits 09.

{"solution": "32. a) A chessboard consisting of $n^{2}$ squares (see Fig. 39, where the case $n=8$ is shown) contains $n$ rows and $n$ columns. To ensure that no two rooks placed on this board threaten each other, it is necessary that no two rooks stand on the same row or the same column. It is clear, therefore, that the total number of rooks cannot exceed $n$, and $n$ rooks can be placed so that no two of them threaten each other: for example, by placing these rooks along one of the main diagonals of the chessboard.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_68334347b64402497ba5g-148.jpg?height=415&width=416&top_left_y=454&top_left_x=598)\n\nFig. 39. \n\nNow let's determine how many different arrangements of $n$ rooks satisfy our conditions. We will call the first rook the one standing on the first column, the second the one standing on the second column, and so on, up to the $n$-th rook standing on the $n$-th column. The first rook can be placed on any of the $n$ rows, after which the second can be placed on any of the $n-1$ remaining rows (the row occupied by the first rook is excluded, as no two rooks should threaten each other), the third rook on any of the $n-2$ remaining unoccupied rows, and so on, up to the $(n-1)$-th rook, for which two unoccupied rows remain, and the last rook, for which only one unoccupied row remains. By combining $n$ different placements of the first rook with $n-1$ different placements of the second rook, we get $n(n-1)$ possible placements of the first two rooks; similarly, we get $n(n-1)(n-2)$ possible placements of the first three rooks, $n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)$ placements of the first four rooks, ..., $n(n-1)(n-2) \\ldots 2 \\cdot 1$ different placements of all $n$ rooks. Therefore, the number of different arrangements is\n\n$$\n1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\ldots(n-1) n=n!\n$$\n\nIn particular, for a standard chessboard, where $n=8$, we get:\n\n$$\n8!=8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1=40320\n$$\n\ndifferent arrangements.\n\nb) All the squares of a chessboard consisting of $n^{2}$ squares cannot be under threat if there are fewer than $n$ rooks on the board. Indeed, in this case, there is at least one column without any rook; the $n$ squares of this column cannot all be under threat from the placed rooks, as the number of rooks is less than $n$ and none of them can threaten two squares of the considered column simultaneously; $n$ rooks, satisfying the conditions of the problem, can obviously be placed (see, for example, Fig. 39).\n\nIf $n$ rooks, placed on a chessboard consisting of $n^{2}$ squares, threaten all the squares of the board, then either there is one rook on each column of the board or one rook on each row. Indeed, if there were both a column and a row free from rooks, then the square at the intersection of these column and row would not be under threat. The number of ways to place rooks, one on each of the $n$ columns, is $n^{n}$ (the first rook can be placed in $n$ ways on one of the squares of the first column; the second, independently of the first, in $n$ ways on one of the squares of the second column, and so on). The number of ways to place $n$ rooks, one on each of the $n$ rows, is obviously also $n^{n}$. At first glance, it might seem that the total number of arrangements of $n$ rooks, under which they threaten all the squares of the board, is $n^{n}+n^{n}=2 n^{n}$. However, in this count, each arrangement where there is one rook on each column and simultaneously one rook on each row is counted twice. Since the total number of these latter arrangements is $n!$ (see the solution to part a)), the correct answer to the question is $2 n^{n}-n!$.\n\nIn particular, for a standard chessboard ($n=8$), we get:\n\n$$\n2 \\cdot 8^{8}-8!=33514312\n$$\n\ndifferent arrangements.", "extra_info": {"cot_type": null, "domain": null, "llama8b_solve_rate": null, "metadata": null, "problem_type": "Combinatorics", "question_type": "math-word-problem"}, "source": "NuminaMath-1.5 olympiads", "prompt": [{"content": "32. a) What is the maximum number of rooks that can be placed on a chessboard of $n^{2}$ squares so that no two rooks threaten each other?

If you double any member of the sequence and add the previous one, you get the member that follows the given one by two. Further, in the first year, the offspring will be 0 calves, in the second 1, in the third 1, in the fourth 2, and so on. This way, the members of this sequence will be obtained. The twenty-fifth member is 46368, and if we add all 25 members, we get the correct answer 121392. But there is no need to perform this addition. By finding the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth members, we can simply say that 46368, multiplied by 2, plus 28657 equals 121393, and then subtract 1.", "extra_info": {"cot_type": null, "domain": null, "llama8b_solve_rate": null, "metadata": null, "problem_type": "Combinatorics", "question_type": "math-word-problem"}, "source": "NuminaMath-1.5 olympiads", "prompt": [{"content": "173.

{"solution": "Due to the symmetry of the regular 100-gon, each number appears in the sets at the 13th position the same number of times, which means the number of sets is a multiple of 100. If the regular 100-gon is continuously rotated counterclockwise around its center, then, first, all sets will appear, and second, the change of sets, if it occurs, will only happen when one of the diagonals or sides of the 100-gon is parallel to the edge of the table.

{"solution": "We number the rows from top to bottom and the columns from left to right with numbers from 1 to 100.\n\nIn each row, there can be from 0 to 100 black cells. Since the number of black cells in all rows are different, these numbers are all from 0 to 100, except for one (say, except for $k$). Therefore, the total number of black cells is $(0+1+\\ldots+100)-k=5050-k$. On the other hand, since the number of black cells in all columns is the same, the total number of black cells must be divisible by 100. Thus, $k=50$, and in all columns there are $5000: 100=50$ black cells.\n\nEstimation. If a row has $n \\leq 49$ black cells, then they can participate in no more than 98 horizontal pairs. If a row has $n \\geq 51$ black cells, a similar argument can be applied to the white cells, of which there are $100-n \\leq 49$. Therefore, the number of horizontal pairs of different colors is no more than\n$2(2 \\cdot 0+2 \\cdot 1+\\ldots+2 \\cdot 49)=4900$.\n\nNow let's estimate the number of vertical pairs. Consider any row with an even number from 2 to 98; let it have $n$ black cells. Then either the row above it or the row below it has a number of black cells that is not equal to $100-n$; thus, one of the vertical pairs involving the cells of our row will be of the same color. Therefore, there are at least 49 vertical pairs of the same color. Since the total number of vertical pairs is 9900, the number of different-colored vertical pairs is no more than $9900-49=9851$. Therefore, the total number of different-colored pairs is no more than $9900+9851=14751$.\n\nExample. Draw a diagonal from the top left corner to the bottom right corner in our table.

An example of such a coloring for an $8 \\times 8$ table is shown in the figure.

{"solution": "SOLUTION. We will prove in two separate parts that satellites can form at least 600 and at most 5400 connected triples. Throughout the text, $S$ will denote the set of tangent satellites, $n=50$ their number, and $m=225$ the number of communication lines.\n\na) The maximum possible number of connected triples is 5400.\n\nA triple of satellites is connected if and only if it contains two or three communication lines. It is therefore beneficial for each possible value $i \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$ to denote as $t_{i}$ the number of those triples of satellites that have exactly $i$ communication lines. We claim that these numbers satisfy the equation\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{3} i \\cdot t_{i}=m \\cdot (n-2)\n$$\n\nIndeed, both sides express the total number of ordered pairs $(T, l)$, where $T$ is a triple of satellites and $l$ is a communication line between two satellites of this triple, because on the left side we count for each individual $T$ how many pairs $(T, l)$ a given $T$ appears in, while the right side (1) expresses the fact that each $l$ appears in $n-2$ pairs $(T, l)$.\n\nFrom the proven equation (1) rewritten in the form $t_{1}+2 t_{2}+3 t_{3}=m(n-2)$, we get an estimate for the number $t_{2}+t_{3}$ of all connected triples of satellites:\n\n$$\nt_{2}+t_{3}=\\frac{m(n-2)-t_{1}-t_{3}}{2} \\leqq \\frac{m(n-2)}{2}=5400\n$$\n\nthe desired equality $t_{2}+t_{3}=5400$ holds if and only if $t_{1}=t_{3}=0$.

In the case of two identical columns, the existence of a rectangle with identically colored corner cells is obvious. If no two columns are identical, but there is a monochromatic column of color A, there must be a column in the rectangle where two cells have color A.

{"solution": "Solution to Exercise 2 Let $A$ and $B$ be two disjoint sets whose union is equal to the set $E=\\{1, \\ldots, 8\\}$.\n\nFirst, let's try to maximize the sum $P_{A}+P_{B}$.

The arithmetic-geometric inequality indicates that $P_{A}+P_{B} \\geqslant 2 c$, where we have set $c=\\sqrt{P_{A} P_{B}}=\\sqrt{8!}$. Since $401^{2}=160801401$, and thus $P_{A}+P_{B} \\geqslant\\lceil 2 c\\rceil \\geqslant 402$.\n\nA first instinct is therefore to look for two sets $A$ and $B$ such that $P_{A}+P_{B}=402$. We then make some preliminary remarks to this search. First, knowing which set contains the integer 1 makes no difference. Then we prove that one of the two sets contains the integer 6 and the other contains the integers 2 and 3. Indeed, let $X$ be the set that contains 6 and $Y$ the one that does not contain 6:\n\n$\\triangleright$ since $P_{Y} \\equiv 402-P_{X} \\equiv 0(\\bmod 6)$, it follows that $Y$ contains the integer 3 and an even integer;\n\n$\\triangleright$ if it is $X$ that contains the integer 2, then $P_{Y} \\equiv 402-P_{X} \\equiv 2(\\bmod 4)$, so $X$ contains an even integer but not divisible by 4, which is impossible.\n\nBy removing the integers $1,2,3$ and 6 from the sets $A$ and $B$, we are thus reduced to finding a partition of the set $\\hat{E}=\\{4,5,7,8\\}$ into two subsets $\\hat{A}$ and $\\hat{B}$ such that $P_{\\hat{A}}+$ $P_{\\hat{B}}=402 / 6=67$. Suppose, without loss of generality, that $\\hat{A}$ contains the integer 4. Then $P_{\\hat{B}} \\equiv 67-P_{\\hat{A}} \\equiv 1(\\bmod 2)$, so $\\hat{A}$ also contains the integer 8. Furthermore, if $\\hat{A}$ also contains one of the two integers 5 or 7, then $P_{\\hat{A}}+P_{\\hat{B}} \\geqslant P_{\\hat{A}} \\geqslant 4 \\times 5 \\times 8 \\geqslant 160>67$. Therefore, we must necessarily have $\\hat{A}=\\{4,8\\}$ and $\\hat{B}=\\{5,7\\}$, and we are happy to verify that, in this case, we indeed have $P_{\\hat{A}}+P_{\\hat{B}}=32+35=67$.\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum value of $P_{A}+P_{B}$ is equal to $P_{\\emptyset}+P_{E}=8!+1=40321$, and the minimum value of $P_{A}+P_{B}$ is equal to $P_{\\{2,3,5,7\\}}+P_{\\{1,4,6,8\\}}=402$.", "extra_info": {"cot_type": null, "domain": null, "llama8b_solve_rate": null, "metadata": null, "problem_type": "Combinatorics", "question_type": "math-word-problem"}, "source": "NuminaMath-1.5 olympiads", "prompt": [{"content": "Exercise 2.

{"solution": "Solution to Exercise 4: We will demonstrate that the integer sought is $A=5 n=2271380$, where we have set $n=674^{2}=(2022 / 3)^{2}$.\n\nFirst, here is a strategy for the woodpecker. He numbers the rows and columns from 1 to 2022, then colors black each cell located in a column $c$ and a row $\\ell$ for which 3 does not divide either $c$ or $\\ell$. Among the four to nine cells on which the gardener acts each turn, at most four are black. The woodpecker then selects the black cells in question; if this results in fewer than four cells, he chooses other cells at random.\n\nBy doing so, he ensures that, at the end of the game turn, no tree located in a black cell will have grown taller. An immediate induction indicates that no tree located in a black cell will ever exceed a height of 1, and since there are $4 n$ black cells, it will never be possible to exceed a total of $2022^{2}-4 n=5 n$ splendid trees.\n\nConversely, here is a strategy for the gardener; we set $m=10^{6}$. Ignoring the coloring imposed by the woodpecker, he colors red each cell located in a column $c$ and a row $\\ell$ for which $c \\equiv \\ell \\equiv 2(\\bmod 3)$. There are $n$ red cells, and each cell is either red or adjacent to a red cell. The gardener then sets $k=(4 n+1) m+1$ and, during the first $k n$ turns of the game, he chooses each red cell exactly $k$ times. He has thus increased the height of each tree in the garden by $k$.\n\nLet $a$ be the number of trees that are not splendid at the end of this first part of the game: the woodpecker must have chosen each of these $a$ trees at least $k-m$ times. Since he chose $4 k n$ trees during the $k n$ turns of the game, we deduce that $a(k-m) \\leqslant 4 k n$, and thus that\n\n$$\n(k-m)(a-4 n-1) \\leqslant 4 k n-(k-m)(4 n+1)=(4 n+1) m-k\n$$\n\nMany students made false dichotomies for the woodpecker's strategy: either he always attacks the same trees, or he flutters uniformly. Of course, intermediates are possible, where the woodpecker mainly targets certain trees but sometimes goes to others.\n\n$\\triangleright$ The main error, however, is this: a good strategy for one of the two players having been found, it is absolutely forbidden to use it to find a \"reactive\" strategy for the other player. Even if you are convinced that the gardener has an interest in playing in the middle of $3 \\times 3$ squares, it is impossible to assume this to describe the woodpecker's strategy. Even if you are convinced that the woodpecker has an interest in choosing a certain number of trees against which he harbors a thousand-year-old grudge and to attack them as soon as the gardener tries to make them grow, it is impossible to assume this to describe the gardener's strategy. Indeed, even if there are optimal strategies for each of the two players that meet these reasonable constraints, there are also equally effective strategies that do not work this way.\n\nHere is how to proceed for a confrontation between two players: the proof must be divided into two completely separate parts that will not share any common argument. On the one hand, a strategy for the woodpecker must be given that ensures a certain score even if the gardener plays chaotically. It is then crucial to make no assumptions about the gardener's strategy and to avoid false dichotomies; the gardener should be allowed to \"play badly\" in this part if he wishes, as it is always simpler than justifying that his \"bad\" move could not become good in a distant future. In the second half of the proof, everything is reversed, a strategy for the gardener is given that remains valid even if the woodpecker does not follow the strategy just described, even if he also plays chaotically, without making any assumptions about his strategy.", "extra_info": {"cot_type": null, "domain": null, "llama8b_solve_rate": null, "metadata": null, "problem_type": "Combinatorics", "question_type": "math-word-problem"}, "source": "NuminaMath-1.5 olympiads", "prompt": [{"content": "Exercise 4.

{"solution": "## Solution\n\nThe 01 has no importance here; we will therefore drop it and treat the numbers as if they only contained 8 digits. We will say that two numbers are adjacent if they differ in only one position, calling \"position\" one of the 8 positions where the digits of a number are located.\n\nFirst, let's show that it is indeed possible to assign 10000000 numbers.\n\nChoose the first 7 digits of the number arbitrarily, which represents $10^{7}$, or ten million distinct possibilities. To each of these, associate an eighth digit so that the sum of the eight digits is divisible by 10. For example, to 4427667, which satisfies: $4+4+2+7+6+6+7=36$, we associate 4 so that $(4+4+2+7+6+6+7)+4=40$ is divisible by 10, and we decide that among the numbers starting with 4427667, it is 44276674 that will be assigned: this is always possible regardless of the first seven digits. If one and only one of the eight digits is changed, the sum increases or decreases by a difference of two distinct digits, necessarily between 1 and 9. The new sum cannot be divisible by 10, so the obtained number cannot be assigned. This example alone shows that it is possible to assign 10000000 distinct numbers that meet the condition of the problem. And this is not the only example!\n\nNow let's show that it is never possible to assign more than 10000000 numbers.\n\n## Variant $A$\n\nConsider a set of assigned numbers conforming to the conditions of the problem. Two of them can never have the same digits in the first 7 positions (following the 01), because then these numbers would be adjacent (they would differ only by the last position). Therefore, for each sequence of 7 digits, there is at most one assigned number that starts with this sequence. There are therefore at most 10000000 assigned numbers.\n\n## Variant $B$\n\nFirst, we note that each number is adjacent to exactly 72 other numbers. Indeed, consider a number $X$. If $X^{\\prime}$ is another number adjacent to $X$, $X^{\\prime}$ is entirely determined by the choice of the position $i$ where it differs from $X$, and the digit that occupies this $i$-th position, provided that this digit is different from the $i$-th digit of $X$ (otherwise we would have $\\left.X^{\\prime}=X\\right)$; conversely, each of these choices provides a number adjacent to $X$. Since there are 8 positions, and for any chosen position, 9 digits can occupy it, there are therefore $8 \\times 9=72$ possibilities in total.\n\nConsider a set of assigned numbers conforming to the conditions of the problem. Let $a$ be the number of assigned numbers, $n=10^{8}$ the total number of numbers. We call $m$ the number of pairs $(A, B)$ where $A$ is an assigned number and $B$ is a number adjacent to it (and therefore not assigned). Estimate $m$ in two different ways:\n\n- There are $a$ ways to choose $A$. According to what precedes, for each value of $A$, there are 72 ways to choose $B$. Therefore, $m=72a$.\n- There are $n-a$ ways to choose $B$. Fix the value of $B$, and choose a position $i$. Then among the numbers that are adjacent to $B$ by the position $i$, at most one is assigned (since these 9 numbers are all adjacent to each other). Therefore, there are at most 8 assigned numbers adjacent to $B$. Note! Nothing allows us to assert a priori that there are exactly 8.\n\nBut we have $m \\leq 8(n-a)$. Combining the two conditions, we get: $72a \\leq 8(n-a)$, or $80a \\leq 8n$, so $a \\leq \\frac{n}{10}=10000000$.", "extra_info": {"cot_type": null, "domain": null, "llama8b_solve_rate": null, "metadata": null, "problem_type": "Combinatorics", "question_type": "proof"}, "source": "NuminaMath-1.5 olympiads", "prompt": [{"content": "Exercise 5. In the Paris region, fixed telephone numbers consist of the digits 01 followed by eight other digits (for example, 01.99.98.10.00 or 01.00.00.35.77, etc.). To limit accidental calls, it has been decided that if a telephone number is dialed with only one digit wrong, the call will always reach an unassigned number: for example, if 01.99.98.10.00 is assigned, then 01.89.98.10.00 and 01.99.98.10.30 are unassigned. What is the maximum number of different telephone numbers that can be assigned in the Paris region? Justify your answer carefully.\n\n## Preliminary Remarks\n\nWhen a question asks \"what is the maximum number of...\", the proof involves two steps: it is necessary to show, on the one hand, that a certain number can be obtained (often by providing an example), and on the other hand, that it is impossible to obtain more. Perhaps some have thought that the words \"at most\" mean that it is only necessary to find an upper bound. This interpretation does not hold: it would have been enough to say \\(10^8\\) to solve the problem!\n\nThe first part was worth 3 points and the second part, 4 points. However, certain gross errors justified a 0 on their own: non-integer or greater than the total number of available numbers, arithmetic operation errors... The ideas are sometimes so confused that pinpointing the exact error is very difficult, especially since there are often several!\n\nOn the other hand, as long as a copy did not contain a gross error of this kind and contained at least one correct statement (excluding the remark that there are \\(10^8\\) numbers in total), it deserved a point. Many believed that since there are 72 ways to make a mistake on a number, no more than one number in 73 could be assigned. This is one of more than thirty different results found in the copies, and it is false because an incorrect number can correspond to several assigned numbers. However, those who made this reasoning but noticed and explained their error (and did not make any other) earned an additional point.\n\nSome Advice\n\nBe precise and detailed in your writing. Clearly show the logical structure so that it is clear which arguments support which statements. Always clearly define the objects you are manipulating. Avoid circumlocutions; introduce rather notations and definitions. Be careful with pronouns, \"this,\" \"that,\" and other ambiguous words. Be careful with \"in the same way,\" \"likewise,\" \"by analogy\"... Each time you write such vague or elliptical formulations, ask yourself two questions. The most important: \"Am I sure I have a clear idea of what I am writing?\" And then, \"Will the grader understand the same thing?\" But remember: what is well conceived is clearly expressed.\n\nWhen the answer is \"no,\" try to detail it. Tell yourself that the more you detail, the more chances you have of catching an error you didn't see and thus obtaining a correct result at the end. In the solution below, deliberately very detailed, absolutely every sentence, and almost every word, serves a purpose.

The total number of such words is $2^{7}+2^{8}+\\cdots+2^{13}=2^{14}-2^{7}$.\n\nWe will prove that this is the maximum number of words that can be found in a language.

{"solution": "Solution: For parts (a) and (b), see the tilings below of a decagon and a dodecagon with rhombuses.\n(c) Solution 1: We shall describe an algorithm for tiling any regular $2 n$-gon. First construct a rhombus $A$ using two sides of a regular $2 n$-gon. On the two interior sides construct two rhombuses $B$ using a side adjacent and clockwise to the exterior sides of $A$. On the three interior sides of the $B$ rhombuses construct three rhombuses $C$ using the next side of the $2 n$-gon going clockwise. After the $(n-2)^{n d}$ step an outer layer of $n-2$ rhombuses is in place. To see that the $(n-1)^{\\text {st }}$ step completes the $2 n$-gon note that the $(n+1)^{s t}$ side after the first side of $A$ is parallel and equal in length to the first side of $A$ and has the same length as the $n$th side of the $2 n$-gon. Therefore it is a rhombus. In the same way, the remaining $n-1$ sides of the $2 n$-gon form rhombuses with segments parallel to the $n^{\\text {th }}$ side. The total number of rhombuses is the sum of the first $n-1$ integers. Then it is the case that a regular 2002-gon can be tiled with $1+2+3+\\cdots+999+1000=1000(1001) / 2=500(1001)=500,500$ rhombuses.\n\nSolution 2: We will prove the slightly more general fact that any equilateral $2 n$-gon with opposite sides parallel (we will call such polygons \"EP-gons\") can be tiled with $1+2+\\cdots+n-1$ rhombuses. We proceed by induction on $n$. Certainly the result is true for $n=2$, since a 4 -sided EP-gon is simply a single rhombus.\n\nFor the inductive step, suppose we have $(2 n+2)$-sided EP-gon. We will use the leftmost figure above for reference; thus in this case $n=4$. Select one side of this polygon (we will use the \"bottom\" side in the picture, one of the sides of rhombus $A$ ). Then draw $n-1$ lines parallel to this side with lengths equal to this side, each line starting at a vertex of the polygon. Then draw $n$ lines parallel to the sides of the polygon; when we are done we will have drawn a \"shell\" of $n$ rhombuses on the left of the polygon (rhombus $A$ and the leftmost rhombuses $B, C$, and $D$ ). We claim that the remainder of the $(2 n+2)$-gon (the non-tiled region) is a $2 n$-sided EP-gon. To see this, note that the untiled region consists of $n$ sides of the right half of the original $(2 n+2)$-gon, plus $n$ new sides, each drawn parallel\n(and equal in length) to a side of the left half of the original $(2 n+2)$-gon. It is as if we rigidly slided the left half of the original $(2 n+2)$-gon to the right, so that the top and bottom sides of the original polygon disappeared. Thus in this new region, opposite sides are parallel. By the inductive hypothesis, this region can be tiled with $1+2+\\cdots+(n-1)$ rhombuses. Thus the original $(2 n+2)$-gon can be tiled by $1+2+3+\\cdots+(n-1)+n$ rhombuses.", "extra_info": {"cot_type": null, "domain": null, "llama8b_solve_rate": null, "metadata": null, "problem_type": "Combinatorics", "question_type": "math-word-problem"}, "source": "NuminaMath-1.5 olympiads", "prompt": [{"content": "2 In the illustration, a regular hexagon and a regular octagon have been tiled with rhombuses.

{"solution": "Solve by generalizing the problem. Below, we discuss the general case of $n$ space stations and $n$ bidirectional main lines, where $n$ is an odd number greater than 3, and let $m=\\frac{1}{2}(n-3)$. In this problem, $n=99, m=48$.\n(1) If among four space stations, one station has channels that are strictly unidirectional from that station to the other three, then this set of four stations is not a mutually connected four-station group. We classify such non-mutually connected four-station groups into class $S$, and the rest of the non-mutually connected four-station groups into class $T$. Thus, the total number of mutually connected four-station groups is\n$$\nN_{n}=C_{n}^{4}-|T|-|S| .\n$$\n\nLabel the $n$ space stations as $1,2, \\cdots, n$. Let the number of strictly unidirectional channels from station $i$ be $x_{i}$. Then the total number of non-mutually connected four-station groups in class $S$ is $|S|=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} C_{x_{i}}^{3}$, and\n$$\nx_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots+x_{n}=C_{n}^{2}-n=\\frac{1}{2} n(n-3)=n m .\n$$\n\nTo maximize $N_{n}$, $|T|$ and $|S|$ must be minimized.\nFirst, we prove that $|S| \\geqslant n C_{m}^{3}$. In fact, when $|S|$ takes its minimum value, for any $1 \\leqslant i < j \\leqslant n$, if $x_{i} < m$ and $x_{j} > m$, then by increasing $x_{i}$ by 1 and decreasing $x_{j}$ by 1, the value of $|S|$ decreases (since $\\left(x_{j}-1\\right)-x_{i} \\geqslant 1$), which contradicts the minimality of $|S|$.\nThus, $|S| \\geqslant n C_{m}^{3}$, and equality holds if and only if $x_{1}=x_{2}=\\cdots=x_{n}=m$. Therefore,\n$$\nN_{n}=C_{n}^{4}-|T|-|S| \\leqslant C_{n}^{4}-0-n C_{m}^{3}=\\frac{1}{48} n(n-3)\\left(n^{2}+6 n-31\\right).\n$$\n(2) The following design shows that $N_{n}=C_{n}^{4}-n C_{m}^{3}$ can be achieved.\nFirst, arrange the space stations numbered $1,2, \\cdots, n$ in a clockwise order on $n$ points $A_{1}$, $A_{2}, \\cdots, A_{n}$ on a circle. The channels between adjacent space stations on the circle are bidirectional main lines, thus setting up $n$ bidirectional main lines:\n$A_{1} A_{2}, A_{2} A_{3}, \\cdots, A_{n-1} A_{n}, A_{n} A_{1}$.\nFor any $i, j \\in\\{1,2,3, \\cdots, n\\}, i \\neq j$, if the arc from $A_{i}$ to $A_{j}$ in the clockwise direction passes through an odd number of space stations, then the channel between $A_{i}$ and $A_{j}$ is a strictly unidirectional channel from $A_{i}$ to $A_{j}$: $A_{i} \\rightarrow A_{j}$. Since $n$ is odd, one of the clockwise arcs from $A_{i}$ to $A_{j}$ and from $A_{j}$ to $A_{i}$ passes through an odd number of space stations. Hence, the above rule does not lead to any contradiction.\n\nAccording to this design, the number of strictly unidirectional channels from each $A_{i}$ is $m=\\frac{n-3}{2}$, so $|S|=$ $n C_{m}^{3}$. We now prove that in this design, $|T|=0$.\n\nIf a four-station group has a bidirectional main line between two stations $A$ and $B$, then it is easy to see that this four-station group is mutually connected. Therefore, if a four-station group $A, B, C, D$ is not mutually connected, then there are no bidirectional main lines between any two stations. Let the number of space stations between $A$ and $B$, $B$ and $C$, $C$ and $D$, and $D$ and $A$ be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, respectively. Thus, $a+b+c+d=n-4$ is odd. Therefore, the number of odd numbers among $a, b, c, d$ is 1 or 3.\n(i) If $a$ is odd and $b, c, d$ are even, then $A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow D \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow A$, and $A, B, C, D$ form a mutually connected four-station group (Figure 4-15(a)).\n(ii) If $a, b, c$ are odd and $d$ is even, then the channels from $A$ to $B, C, D$ are all strictly unidirectional channels from $A$. Such a non-mutually connected four-station group belongs to class $S$ (Figure 4-15(b)).\nFrom the above discussion, we know that in this design, $|T|=0$.\nIn summary, the maximum number of mutually connected four-station groups is $C_{n}^{4}-n C_{\\frac{3-3}{2}}^{3}=\\frac{1}{48} n(n-3)\\left(n^{2}+6 n-31\\right)$.

{"solution": "5. Consider a more general problem, replacing 2019 with a positive integer $n (n \\geqslant 4)$.\n\nBelow is the proof: In a convex $n$-gon where no three diagonals have a common point, the maximum number of colored intersections such that no colored cycle exists is $\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}-1$.\n\nFirst, prove that the number of colored intersections must be less than $\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$.\nProof by contradiction.\nAssume the number of colored intersections is not less than $\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$. Consider a planar graph where the vertices correspond to the diagonals of the polygon, and the edges correspond to the colored intersections. Since the number of diagonals in a convex $n$-gon is $\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$, the number of edges in this planar graph is at least the number of vertices. Therefore, the graph contains a cycle. It is easy to see that the cycles in the graph correspond one-to-one with the colored cycles in the polygon. Thus, there exists a colored cycle, which is a contradiction.\n\nNext, find a way to color $\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}-1$ intersections such that no colored cycle exists. Use induction.\nWhen $n=4$, the conclusion is obvious.\nAssume the conclusion holds for a convex $n$-gon, i.e., for any convex $n$-gon, there exists a way to color $\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}-1$ intersections such that no colored cycle exists.\nNow consider a convex $(n+1)$-gon $A_{1} A_{2} \\cdots A_{n+1}$.\nFor the $n$-gon $A_{1} A_{2} \\cdots A_{n}$, by the induction hypothesis, $\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}-1$ intersections have been colored. Adding the vertex $A_{n+1}$, the edge $A_{1} A_{n}$ in the $n$-gon $A_{1} A_{2} \\cdots A_{n}$ is transformed into a diagonal in the convex $(n+1)$-gon $A_{1} A_{2} \\cdots A_{n+1}$, and $n-2$ additional diagonals $A_{n+1} A_{i} (i=2,3, \\cdots, n-1)$ are added. Thus, the diagonal $A_{1} A_{n}$ contains exactly $n-2$ intersections (corresponding to the added diagonals), and all of them are colored.\n\nFinally, color one intersection on a diagonal passing through $A_{n+1}$ that is not on $A_{1} A_{n}$, for example, the intersection of $A_{n+1} A_{2}$ and $A_{1} A_{3}$ (due to the convexity of the polygon, this intersection is inside the $(n+1)$-gon, so it is an \"intersection\"). In total, there are\n$$\n\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}-1+(n-1)=\\frac{(n+1)(n-2)}{2}-1\n$$\ncolored intersections. Among the newly colored $n-1$ points, adjacent intersections only appear on the diagonals $A_{1} A_{n}$ or $A_{n+1} A_{2}$.

{"solution": "6. (a) First, find the pattern of the sequence: $W_{1}=0, W_{2}=001, W_{3}=W_{2} W_{2} W_{1}$. Using mathematical induction, we can prove that $W_{k+1}=W_{k} W_{k} W_{k-1}$. Let $a_{k}, b_{k}$ be the number of digits 0 and 1 in $W_{k}$. Then $a_{k+1}=2 a_{k}+a_{k-1}, b_{k}=a_{k-1}$, and let $t_{k}=\\frac{a_{k}}{a_{k-1}}$, then $t_{k+1}=\\frac{a_{k+1}}{a_{k}}=2+\\frac{1}{t_{k}}$. Taking the limit as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, we get $t=2+\\frac{1}{t}$ or $t=\\sqrt{2}+1$, indicating that $\\frac{a_{k}}{b_{k}}$ tends to an irrational number. For this infinite 0,1 sequence, we have the following conclusions: $\\frac{\\text{number of 0s}}{\\text{number of 1s}} \\rightarrow \\sqrt{2}+1, \\frac{\\text{number of 0s}}{\\text{total digits}} \\rightarrow \\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{2+\\sqrt{2}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, $\\frac{\\text{number of 1s}}{\\text{total digits}} \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2+\\sqrt{2}}$. Thus, every $2+\\sqrt{2}$ digits, there is 1 occurrence of 1, i.e., the position of the $n$-th 1 is approximately $(2+\\sqrt{2}) n$ digits, and the position of the $n$-th 0 is approximately $\\sqrt{2} n$ digits.\nTo solve the next problem, we need the following table:\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline$n$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\\\\n\\hline$a_{n}$ & 1 & 2 & 5 & 12 & 29 & 70 & 169 & 408 & 985 & 2378 & 5741 & 13860 \\\\\n\\hline$b_{n}$ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 5 & 12 & 29 & 70 & 169 & 408 & 985 & 2378 & 5741 \\\\\n\\hline$a_{n}+b_{n}$ & 1 & 3 & 7 & 17 & 41 & 99 & 239 & 577 & 1393 & 3363 & 9119 & 19601 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n(b) Using the table, we know that the 1000th digit is within the word $W_{9}$. However, $W_{9}=W_{8} W_{8} W_{7}$. The length of this word is $577+577+239$. Thus, the 1000th digit is within the word $W_{8} W_{8}$. Further expanding, we get $W_{8} W_{7} W_{7} W_{6}$. Removing the last $W_{6}$, and expanding the last $W_{7}$, we get $W_{8} W_{7} W_{6} W_{6} W_{5}$. Continuing to remove the last term and expanding the previous term, we finally get $W_{8} W_{7} W_{6} W_{5} W_{5} W_{2}$, which is a word of length 1000. Therefore, the 1000th digit is the last digit of $W_{2}$, which is 1.\n(c) Similarly, we get the word $W_{12} W_{11} W_{9} W_{8} W_{8} W_{6} W_{3} W_{3}$, whose last digit 1 is the position of the 10000th 1 in the sequence.

{"solution": "Solution 1: Call the original problem the \"Two Kings Problem\". If we add another wild card (called the \"Middle King\"), also numbered 0, and then consider the same problem, it is referred to as the \"Three Kings Problem\".\n\nFirst, consider the \"Three Kings Problem\". Let the large, medium, and small wild cards be called the Red King, Yellow King, and Blue King, respectively. Thus, each color has 11 cards, numbered $0, 1, 2, \\cdots, 10$. Let the number of card groups with a total score of $n$ be denoted as $u_{n}$. Each card group can be composed of a Red Group, a Yellow Group, and a Blue Group, with the total scores of the Red Group, Yellow Group, and Blue Group denoted as $x$, $y$, and $z$, respectively, such that\n$$\nx+y+z=n.\n$$\n\nSince the binary representation of any non-negative integer is unique, once the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ are determined, the composition of the Red Group, Yellow Group, and Blue Group is uniquely determined.

(ii) If the group contains wild cards, then the group must contain 2 wild cards (both the large and small wild cards are in the group).

Also, for any $y \\in A$, let $x=f_{29}(y) \\in A$, then $f(x)=f_{30}(y)=y$, so $f$ is surjective, hence $f$ is a bijection.\n\nNext, we prove that in $A$ there only exist mapping cycles of $f$, and no mapping chains. That is, for any $a_{i} \\in A$, there exists $k_{i} \\in \\mathbf{N}_{+}$ such that $f_{k_{i}}\\left(a_{i}\\right)=a_{i}$, and $f_{s}\\left(a_{i}\\right) \\neq a_{i}\\left(s \\in \\mathbf{N}_{+}, 1 \\leqslant s \\leqslant k_{i}-1\\right)$. In fact, for any $a_{i} \\in A$, we have $f\\left(a_{i}\\right)=a_{i}$ (in this case $k_{i}=1$) or $f\\left(a_{i}\\right)=a_{i_{1}} \\neq a_{i}$.

The number of triples decreases by 3 when the value of $m$ increases by 1 .\nTherefore, when $a$ is even, there are $1005+1002+999+\\cdots+6+3$ triples that satisfy the conditions.\nFinally, the total number of triples that satisfy the given conditions is thus the sum of\n$$\n1007+1004+1001+\\cdots+8+5+2\n$$\nand\n$$\n1005+1002+999+\\cdots+6+3+0\n$$\n\nThe first series is an arithmetic series with first term 1007, last term 2, and including 336 terms in total. (This is because the values of $k$ are from 0 to 335 , inclusive.)\nOne way to determine the sum of an arithmetic series is to multiply the number of terms by one-half and then multiply by the sum of the first and last terms.\nThus, the sum of this series is $\\frac{336}{2}(1007+2)$.\nThe second series is an arithmetic series with first term 1005, last term 0 , and including 336 terms in total. (This is because the values of $m$ are from 1 to 336 , inclusive.)\nThus, its sum is $\\frac{335}{2}(1005+3)$.\nTherefore, the total number of triples is\n$$\n\\frac{336}{2}(1007+2)+\\frac{335}{2}(1005+3)=168(1009)+335(504)=338352\n$$\nANSWER: 338352", "extra_info": {"cot_type": null, "domain": null, "llama8b_solve_rate": null, "metadata": null, "problem_type": "Combinatorics", "question_type": "math-word-problem"}, "source": "NuminaMath-1.5 olympiads", "prompt": [{"content": "6.
